#Saguaro Imageboard
_A fork of saguaro allowing user-created boards._

#Installation Dependencies 
- PHP >= 4.2.x (PHP 5 or newer is also recommended)
- MySQL >= 4.0 
- GD 2.x
- libav (avconv/avprobe) for WebMs

Currently lacking in features saguaro didn't previously have, but now
can afford.

#Installing:
Edit config -> run test.php -> run create.php to make the first board.

## NOT INTENDED FOR MERGING, this is a standalone branch.
